# Data-Structures
# Data Structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data in a computer in order to retrieve,process data efficiently.
# Data Structure is a collection of data and functions that operate on that data.
# Data Structures are used to improve the efficiency of algorithms by reducing the time and space complexity of the algorithm.
# They are used in a wide range of applications, including databases, web pplications, and mobile apps.

# There are two types of data structures namely:
# 1. Primitive Data Structures: These are the basic data types in a programming language such as int, float, char, boolean etc.
# 2. Non-Primitive Data Structures: These are the data structures that are used to store collection of data such as array, linked list, stack,queue, tree, graph etc. These are of two types:
#    a. Linear Data Structures: These are the data structures in which elements are stored in a linear order. Examples of linear data structures are array, linked list, stack, queue etc
#    b. Non-Linear Data Structures: These are the data structures in which elements are not stored in a linear order. Examples of non-linear data structures are tree, graph etc.
